![Radiation](pic.png){width=66%}

$\vartheta =$ reflection angle for redirected radiation $A_{r\parallel}$ parallel to $\alpha$ from matter 
<!-- \footnote{Abstrahlwinkel zur Grenzfläche des Mediums} -->

$\theta =$ diffraction angle for redirected radiation $A_{r\perp}$ orthogonal to $\alpha$ from matter 
<!-- \footnote{Beugungswinkel durch Objekt ins Vakuum} -->

$\varpi = \beta_1 + \beta_2 =$ angle of converging body surfaces (point tip of prismic medium), spread angle of prism

$\varsigma =$ deviation angle of redirected ray beam after refraction (transmission) and diffraction

$u_g =$ aperture angle (acceptance) from sender source (at distance $g$)

$w_b =$ inclination angle at observer receiver (at distance $b$)

$\varepsilon =$ visual angle from observer/receiver (of eye)
